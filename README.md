# typing-game

The game is going to test a player's typing skill, which is one of the most underrated skills all developers should have. We should all be practicing our typing! The general flow of the game will look like this:

- Player clicks on start button and is presented with a quote to type
- Player types the quote as quickly as they can in a textbox
  As each word is completed, the next one is highlighted
  If the player has a typo, the textbox is updated to red
  When the player completes the quote, a success message is displayed with the elapsed time
